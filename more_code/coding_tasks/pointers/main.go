Coding Exercise #1

Consider the following variable declaration x := 10.10

1. Print out the address of x

2. Declare a pointer called ptr that stores the address of x.

3. Print out the type and the value of ptr.

4. Print the address of the pointer and the value of x though the pointer (use the dereferencing operator).

Coding Exercise #2

Consider the following variable declarations: 

    x, y := 10, 2
    ptrx, ptry := &x, &y

Declare a new variable called z and initialize the variable by dividing x by y through the pointers.
