1. Using the var keyword, declare an array called cities with 2 elements of type string. Don't initialize the array.

Print out the cities array and notice the value of its elements

2. Declare an array called grades of type [3]float64 and initialize only the first 2 elements using an array literal.

Print out the cities array and notice the value of its elements

3. Declare an array called taskDone using the ellipsis operator. The elements are of type bool.
